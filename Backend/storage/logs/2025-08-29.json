    "botResponse": "Fine-tuning is the process of taking a pre-trained machine learning model and further training it on a specific dataset to improve its performance on a particular task. This is typically done by adjusting the model's weights using a smaller learning rate and a dataset that is more relevant to the desired application. The goal is to adapt the model's general knowledge to the nuances of the new data while retaining its previously learned features.",
